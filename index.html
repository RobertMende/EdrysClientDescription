        <p>
            This plant is used to determine the influence of reactor temperature, flow rate and concentration on the oxidation of methanol. <br>
            To control these factors, students are able to set the oven temperature, the thermostat temperature of the saturator and the flow rate of the incoming air. <br>
            In order to evaluate the extent of influence of these factors, the exhaust air is split and partially flows through an infrared spectrometer. <br>
            The IR spectrum itself as well as the time-resolved transmission at characteristic wavelengths give semi-quantitative insights into the product distribution. <br>
